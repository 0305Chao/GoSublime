# GoSublime

GoSublime is a plugin for the text editor [SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

It provides code completion from [Gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) as well as some context aware snippets to complement the existing SublimeText Go package.

A demo is available at http://vimeo.com/28246402

# Installation

Installation is simple. Create a new directory in your SublimeText packages directory and copy gosublime.py into it.

You can access your packages directory from within SublimeText by going to the menu "Preferences > Browse Packages..."

Alternatively (recommended), you can simply clone this repo into your packages directory e.g

    cd ~/.sublime-text-2/Packages
    git clone git://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime

Complation can now be accessed by typing the key combination CTRL+[SPACE] inside a Golang file
